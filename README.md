# starter-app
This is a basic starter application implemented using the Ionic framework and React library. The purpose of this project was to learn how to incorporate a simple API that can store data from the app into a database. This has been implemented using the Firebase API, as a means of storing real-time data into the cloud for the application to call on and use when need be.
